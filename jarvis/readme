## Project name: Moon
# About 
ai agen in the style of jarvis from the marvel univers but with a sassy attitudune and slight more annoying to work but still helpfull. the ai should be able to search on the internet write/ read files, open apps on my computer and play music

# üìù To-Do:

-  Dynamic Intent Identification and Plugin Correlation System

- [] Dynamic intent identification and correlation with the plugin system
    What I need to do is, for each plugin, add an extra field: name and description.
    Then, when I load these plugins, I generate a JSON file.
    After that, using FAISS, I create an index and, using cosine similarity, I get the top N results.
    Then I use the LLM to get a better filter, best working for the command.



# Done
- start implementing the RAG  system 
    1. create the emmebeding generator( transform the text got from the internet in numerical expresions)
    2. index the emmebedings 
    3. implement the retrieval and search
